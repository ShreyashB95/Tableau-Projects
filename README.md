Designed and implemented a dynamic Netflix Dashboard using Tableau, showcasing my proficiency in data cleaning, visualization and analytics.
Leveraging Tableau's features, I crafted an interactive dashboard that enables users to explore trends, patterns, and viewer media consumption, offering actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
Found insights on movies and tv-show distribution and sum based on ratings, country, genre, year
Created an interactive filter based on movies and tv shows as input and the genre, rating, release year, duration, date added and description as output.
